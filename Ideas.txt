is there a way to restirct the file acces of a computer in a diskdrive? if yes use pocket computers for stuff
maybe even do away with disk drives in general and sync that stuff over the internet or ingame modem system

probably doing user auth using wireless modems

make a system that uses the ingame wireless modems to communicate the shops in range(adjustable by user tho probably max is 64)


TODO: implement the example/default stuff shop and pocket computer tui
